	<h1>CleanSlate Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p><strong>Effective Date</strong>: 08/11/2024</p>

	<p>At CleanSlate, your privacy is our priority. This Privacy Policy outlines how CleanSlate operates with a commitment to your security and privacy.</p>

	<h2>1. Overview</h2>
	<p>CleanSlate is a mobile application that allows users to remotely wipe their devices in case of loss or theft. The app is designed to enhance your device’s security without requiring any personal data from you. CleanSlate does not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII) about you.</p>

	<h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
	<p>CleanSlate is built with privacy in mind. We do not:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personal information.</li>
		<li>Store any of your device’s data, including your location, contacts, messages, or photos.</li>
		<li>Track or log your activity in the app or across your device.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>3. Device and Data Wiping</h2>
	<p>CleanSlate’s primary function is to remotely wipe your device when triggered by you. This action is performed by sending commands directly to the device to remove its content, which we do not access or control. The app interacts with your device on a technical level to complete the wipe process but does not transmit any data to our servers or third parties.</p>

	<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
	<p>CleanSlate does not integrate with any third-party services that may collect or process your data. You can be assured that no third parties have access to your information through our app.</p>

	<h2>5. Security</h2>
	<p>CleanSlate is designed with strong security principles. Since we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no risk of a data breach or loss of your personal information through our app. We also ensure the app is regularly updated to address potential vulnerabilities.</p>

	<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
	<p>CleanSlate is intended for general use and is not directed at children under the age of 13. As we do not collect any personal information, we do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

	<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by updating the effective date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>
